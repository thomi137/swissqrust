# Swiss QR Payment Slips in Rust

This is for the moment an experimental project to generate Swiss payment slips using Rust. The main target was for
me to learn Rust, but since I started Software Development, I was obsessed with speed.
So Java an Python versions, while more easily integratable, to my mind are just slow.  Feel free to fork and send PRs.
